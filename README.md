This project was done as part of the 6 week online course with [Jovian](https://jovian.ai) in collaboration with FreeCodeCamp. I learnt and applied the fundamental concepts of Deep Learning as taught by Aakash from Jovian. He structured the course in such a way that I could learn by building hands-on projects and notebooks rather than watching videos/reading books.
